[Oratio]
Hear, O Lord, we beseech thee, the prayers which we offer thee on this the~
solemn feast-day of thy blessed Confessor and bishop Paulin, and, for the sake of~
him who so nobly served thee, forgive us our trespasses.

[Lectio93]
Paulinus, Bishop of Nola, (was born at Bordeaux in the year 353. He) was learned~
in refined knowledge, and in the Holy Scriptures, and was the author of many~
elegant and polished poems and discourses. The trait in him which is most~
celebrated, is his charity. (In 410,) when the Goths ravaged Campania, [where he~
had a large property,) he spent the whole of his substance, without leaving to~
himself even the necessaries of life, in feeding the destitute and ransoming the~
captives. At this time, as writeth St Austin, from having been a man of great~
wealth, he of his own free will made himself an absolute beggar, but a most~
glorious Saint, and when the Barbarians took him prisoner, he said to God Lord,~
let them not torture me for the sake of my gold and silver, for Thou knowest~
whither it is all gone. When the Vandals afterwards harried the same country, a~
widow came to him, beseeching him that he would ransom her son, and, because he~
had spent all in works of mercy, he gave himself up to slavery in her son's~
stead. As a slave he was carried over to Africa, where his owner, who was the~
King's son-in-law, gave him his garden to keep. But when, through the gift of~
prophecy, he foretold to his master the King's death, and the King himself in a~
dream beheld Paulinus sitting between two judges, and wresting the whip out of~
his hands, his greatness was acknowledged and he was honourably set at large,~
all his fellow-citizens who were also his fellow -prisoners being freely gifted~
to him. He went back to Nola to be Bishop there, and by his word and example to~
stir up all men to Christian godliness. In the midst of his work he was stricken~
down by a pain in the side, and the chamber where he lay being shaken by an~
earthquake, he presently resigned his soul to God, (in the year 431.)

[Lectio94]
Paulinus, born in the year of restored salvation 353 of a very famous Roman family of Bordeaux, acquired the dignity of senator. He was made consul of Nola, but a divine light prompted him to renouce the consulship and return to Bordeaux, where he was baptized by St. Delphinus. Then, giving to the poor the large sum obtained by the sale of his goods, he went to Spain, where he was ordained priest. When he returned to Nola, he built a monastery near the grave of St. Felix and, with the companions who joined him, undertook a most austere cenobitical life. As the fame of his holiness grew, he was elevated to the bishoprick of Nola, in which office he left an example of wonderful devotion, patience, and especially charity. He wrote many works on sacred doctrine and also gained a reputation for eloquence and poetry. When Campánia was devastated by the Goths, he used all his goods to feed the poor and redeem captives. And later, when the Vandals infested the same region and he had nothing more to give, he gave himself into slavery for the son of a widow, and was taken to Africa. At length, restored to liberty, by the hand of God, he died a peaceful death in the Lord at Nola.
