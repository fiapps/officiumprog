Prologue to the Rule of our Holy Father Benedict, continued.

Let us arise, then, at last, for the Scripture stirs us up, saying, "Now is the hour for us to rise from sleep" (Rom. 13:11).
Let us open our eyes to the deifying light, let us hear with attentive ears the warning which the divine voice cries daily to us, "Today if you hear His voice, harden not your hearts" (Ps. 94[95]:8).
And again, "Whoever has ears to hear, hear what the Spirit says to the churches" (Matt. 11-15; Apoc. 2:7).
And what does He say?
"Come, My children, listen to Me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord" (Ps. 33[34]:12).
"Run while you have the light of life, lest the darkness of death overtake you" (John 12:35).
