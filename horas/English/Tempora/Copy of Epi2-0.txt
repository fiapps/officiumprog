Here begins the second letter of St Paul to the Corinthians
!2 Cor 1:1-5
1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother:~
to the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in all~
Achaia:
2 Grace unto you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies,~
and the God of all comfort.
4 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation; that we also may be able to comfort~
them who are in all distress, by the exhortation wherewith we also are exhorted~
by God.
5 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us: so also by Christ doth our~
comfort abound.

[Responsory1]
R. O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thine hot~
displeasure.
* Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak.
V. Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and darkness hath overwhelmed me.
R. Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak.

[Lectio2]
!2 Cor 1:6-7
6 Now whether we be in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and salvation: or~
whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation: or whether we be exhorted,~
it is for your exhortation and salvation, which worketh the enduring of the same~
sufferings which we also suffer.
7 That our hope for you may be steadfast: knowing that as you are partakers of~
the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation.

[Responsory2]
R. O God, Which satest in the throne judging right, be Thou a refuge for the~
poor, a refuge in times of trouble.
* For Thou alone beholdest mischief and spite.
V. The poor leaveth himself unto thee; Thou wilt be the helper of the~
fatherless.
R. For Thou alone beholdest mischief and spite.

[Lectio3]
!2 Cor 1:8-11
8 For we would not have you ignorant,brethren, of our tribulation, which came to~
us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure above our strength, so that we~
were weary even of life.
9 But we had in ourselves the answer of death, that we should not trust in~
ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead.
10 Who hath delivered and doth deliver us out of so great dangers: in whom we~
trust that he will yet also deliver us.
11 You helping withal in prayer for us: that for this gift obtained for us, by~
the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many in our behalf.

Sermo sancti Joannis Chrysostomi.
!Ex Praifatione in Epistolas beati Pauli.
Beati Pauli Epistolarum lectionem dum assidue ausculto, perque hebdomadas~
singulas bis saepe, et ter et quater, quotiescumque sanctorum Martyrum memorias~
celebramus, gaudio exsulto, tuba illa spiritali perfruens, et excitor, ac~
desiderio incalesco, vocem mihi amicam agnoscens, et fere praesentem ipsum~
intueri, et disserentem audire videor. Sed tamen doleo et moleste fero, quod~
virum hunc non omnes, sicut par est, cognoscunt: verum ita illum nonnulli~
ignorant, ut ne Epistoldrum quidem ejus numerum plane sciant Hoc vero non~
imperitia facit: sed quod nolint beati hujus viri scripta assidue in manibus~
habore.

[Responsory4]
R. O Lord, Thou hast shown me the path of life.
* Thou shalt fill me with joy in thy presence, at thy right hand there are~
pleasures for evermore.
V. Thou art He That shalt restore mine inheritance unto me.
R. Thou shalt fill me with joy in thy presence, at thy right hand there are~
pleasures for evermore.

[Lectio5]
Neque enim nos, quae scimus, si quid scimus, ab ingenii bonitate atque acumine~
scimus: sed quod erga hunc virum impense affdcti, ab illius lectione numquam~
discedimus: siquidem qui amant, ii plus quam ceteri omnes eorum facta norunt,~
quos amant, ut qui de iis ipsis sint solliciti. Id quod beatus hic veluti~
ostendens, ad Philippenses ait: Sicut est mihi justum, ut hoc de vobis omnibus~
sentiam, eo quod habeam vos in corde, et in vinculis meis, et in defensione et~
confirmatione Evangelii.

[Responsory5]
R. I will love thee, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my rock
* And my fortress.
V. My Deliverer, my God, mine Helper.
R. And my fortress.

[Lectio6]
Quapropter si et vos quoque lectioni diligenter attendere volueritis, nihil~
aliud vobis erit requirendum. Verax est enim Christi sermo dicentis: Quaerite,~
et invenietis: pulsate, et aperietur vobis. Ceterum, quandoquidem complures ex~
iis, qui huc nobiscum conveniunt, et liberorum educationem, et uxoris curam, et~
familiae providentiam suscepere, ob idque totos sese huic labori dare non~
sustinent: at certe ipsi vos excitate ad ea saltem capienda, quae alii~
coUegerint; studii tantumdem iis, quae dicta fuerint, auscultandis, quantum~
pecuniis coUigendis impertientes. Nam etsi turpe sit, non nisi tantum studii a~
vobis exigere: optabile tamen erit, si tantum saltem tribuatis.

[Responsory6]
R. The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof
* The world, and they that dwell therein.
V. For He hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.
R. The world, and they that dwell therein.
&Gloria
R. The world, and they that dwell therein.

[Lectio7]
From the holy Gospel according to John
!John 2:1-11
In that time there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee: and the mother of Jesus~
was there. And Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the marriage. And~
so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Tract. 9. in John.
Even setting aside any mystical interpretation, the fact that the Lord was~
pleased to be asked, and to go to a marriage, showeth plainly enough that He is~
the Author and Blesser of marriage. There were yet to be those of whom the~
Apostle hath warned us as forbidding to marry ; who say that marriage is a bad~
thing in itself, and a work of the devil. Yet we read in the Gospel that when~
the Lord was asked, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?~
He answered that it was not lawful, except it were for fornication. In which~
answer ye will remember that He used these words : What God hath joined~
together, let not man put asunder.

[Responsory7]
R. Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
* O my God, I trust in thee, let me not be ashamed.
V. O keep my soul and deliver me.
R. O my God, I trust in thee, let me not be ashamed.

[Lectio8]
They who are well instructed in the Catholic religion know that God is the~
Author and Blesser of marriage ; and that, whereas joining together in marriage~
is of God, divorce is of the devil. But it is lawful for a man to put away his~
wife in case of fornication, 8 for by not keeping a wife's faith to her husband~
she herself hath first willed not to be wife. They also who have made a vow of~
their virginity to God and have thereby attained to an higher degree of honour~
and holiness in the Church, are not unmarried, for they are a special part of~
the marriage of the whole Church, which is the Bride of Christ.

[Responsory8]
@Tempora/Pent01-0:Responsory8

[Lectio9]
Lord, being asked, went to the marriage, to strengthen the marriage tie, and to~
shed light on the hidden meaning of matrimony. In that marriage feast the~
Bridegroom to whom it was said, " Thou hast kept the good wine until now," was a~
figure of the Lord Christ, Who hath kept until now the good wine, namely the~
Gospel.
&teDeum

[Versum 2]
V. The Lord reigneth He is clothed with majesty.
R. The Lord is clothed with strength, and has girded Himself with power.

[Ant 2]
There was a marriage * in Cana of Galilee: and Jesus was there, with Mary, his~
mother.

[Ant 3]
The wine failing, * Jesus commanded the water pots to be filled with water,~
which was changed into wine, alleluia.
