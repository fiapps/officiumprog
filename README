Perl CGI for the breviary of the usus antiqior of the Roman Rite (Catholic Church)

This repository is now only of historical interest. It contains some of the last versions of
the CGI programs produced by Laszlo Kiss prior to his death. Active development now takes
place at http://code.google.com/p/divinum-officium/, where the Divinum Officium Project
continues Laszlo's work. Unfortunately, they didn't start with the last version released by
Laszlo, so the data files here are in certain rare cases more correct than the current ones.
